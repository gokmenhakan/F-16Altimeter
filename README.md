# F-16 Altimeter

![Altimeter](pics/altimeter.jpg)

All the files I created my altimeter from...

* The FCStd*-Files are all parts I created in FreeCAD.  
Not all of them are for 3Dprinting, some are just for reference.

* In the folder "3DprintFiles" are the exported parts as .3mf-files to use in your slicer.  
I'm not sure, if all the parts are up2date, since often I do some changes in FreeCAD without exporting the files afterwards.
Best strategy would be to export each part directly from the FreeCAD files.

* The "arduino" folder holds the sourcecode for the Arduino-side of [BMSAIT](https://github.com/mihi4/BMSAIT) by Robin "HummerX" Bruns.  
You can get the Windows program in the link above.
centerController.ini should be used as configuration file in BMSAIT.

I hope to add a BOM for the hardware parts I used ASAP

## !!! Use those files at your own risk !!!

All the files are free to use under the GNUGPLv3
