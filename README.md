# F-16 Altimeter

![Altimeter](pics/altimeter.jpg)

All the files I created my altimeter from...

The FCStd*-Files are all parts I created in FreeCAD. Not all of them are for 3Dprinting, some are just for reference.

In the folder "3DprintFiles" are the exported parts as .3mf-files to use in your slicer. 
I'm not sure, if all the parts are up2date, since often I do some changes in FreeCAD without exporting the files afterwards.
Best strategy would be to export each part directly from the FreeCAD files.

The "arduino" folder holds the sourcecode for the Arduino-side of [BMSAIT](https://github.com/mihi4/BMSAIT) by Robin "HummerX" Bruns.
You can get the Windows program in the link above.
centerController.ini should be used as configuration file in BMSAIT.

!!!! Use those files at your own risk !!!!
